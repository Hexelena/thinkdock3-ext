# thinkdock3-ext
Model of a extension for the Thinkpad Mini Dock Series 3.
It increases the stability of bigger Thinkpads(e.g. T530) especially when used without battery.

It can be attached to the right support socket. 
(which is not supporting when used without battery!)

takes about 4 hrs on a Ultimaker with slow settings
